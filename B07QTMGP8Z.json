            "review_text": "Buyer beware. I bought my NEW Surface Pro, with the Surface Pen and Surface Type Cover purchased separately on March 11 and received them on March 13. It is now May 17 and so far: 1. I have had to replace the charger. I cleaned the pins, I cleaned the slot. I don't use it around food or drinks. My charged has never fallen on the floor. I tested other people's chargers (they worked!) but mine did not. So on May 11, exactly 2 months to the purchase date, I was spending more money on an already expensive product. 2. The day after the new charger was purchased, the Facial Recognition feature stopped working. As in, that little 'eye' and the red dot near the camera disappeared and I was forced to enter my PIN multiple times a day. This meant that if I had a show or podcast that was streaming and I opened my Surface Pro, there was about a 15 second delay in getting the show to stop blasting at whatever volume I had left it at. Huh, you say? (See #3 below) 3. My Surface Pro would begin playing streaming video and podcasts anytime it was plugged in. So, if I had paused a video on it last night, brought it in to work the next morning, and plugged it in to charge WITHOUT opening it at all, it would start the show at full volume on its own. Who pressed play?!?! Many a day I was left scrambling to hit the pause button on a computer I had not even turned on. Remember, it stopped recognizing my face? So I had to enter the PIN? It would take forever to get to that. Meanwhile, my show would be on full blast. The first time it happened, I plugged in the charger, and rushed away from my desk to a meeting. I returned to some VERY NASTY LOOKS from my colleagues. My video had been running, loudly, for the full 20 minutes I was gone. 4. My Surface Pro would start and stop playing paused videos randomly. Like, at 2AM. Do you know how scary it is to have multiple voices out of nowhere in your bedroom while you are sleeping? My husband and I bolted right up with our hearts racing. Were we being robbed? Was there an emergency? No, it was just my Surface Pro watching videos on its own. 5. The keyboard. *SIGH* Today, the type cover just refused to be recognized. No keys, no touchpad, no backlighting. There are times when merely resting the heel of my palms on the cover (to the sides of the touchpad but below the keys - an area that should have zero functionality or consequence), while typing would cause strange menus and functions to appear onscreen. I'm typing the body of an email and suddenly my text is in the subject line. Of course I don't realize this until a good paragraph in and I can't find the words I'm typing but they have jumped up to the subject line. Or, I'm using the touchpad and in the middle of typing and suddenly 2 other open pages are closed out. 6. Facial Recognition has been restored. Wait, so why am I listing it here as a complaint? Well, that's because I did absolutely nothing to bring it back. So that function seems to come and go at will. Which means I have no control over when it will disappear again. So I have to immediately close every page that has a video after I'm done watching it or take a chance that it'll start playing and facial recognition (the quickest way to turn on my computer) will vanish again and everyone withing earshot will know exactly what i was watching last night. I just bought this computer 2 months ago. Is this what I should expect of a new product?",

I have been very impressed with the Surface Pro 6. I bought it to replace my iPad and laptop. I use the Kingston Blackbelt 2nd Degree Case and a magnetic privacy screen. It's lightweight, durable, and the screen is crystal. Keeping it clean is a bit of a challenge, so you may want to get a screen protector. Battery life is questionable, and really depends on the applications you run, this applies to every battery operated Windows device. I have fully replaced my iPad with this, knowing they aren't really comparable to each other. The Surface is very much a full-fledged computer, able to function and perform well - while an iPad is basically just an oversized faster iPhone.",

I didn't think a device so small could be as functional as a laptop or PC. It is for everything I do. I'm not a gamer (that's what consoles are for, in my opinion), but I'll include some of the programs I use, that work better on this Surface Pro 6 than they did on my former PC (Asus MAXIMUS V GENE Z77, i7-3770, 16GB DDR3, Corsair 256 SSD, Windows 10 Ultimate) . Programs: MacXHD Video Converter, ConvertXtoDVD, Adobe Photoshop CS5, AutoCAD 2019 and Inventor 2019. The Surface I have is fan-less, and I haven't had any heat issued when using intense programs like converting videos, burning DVD's (with an external, USB DVD drive) nor whilst using Inventor creating 3D assemblies. The 12 inch screen will certainly suffice when surfing the net and doing simple tasks, however I use a 24 inch monitor while working via the mini display port. I would recommend the Surface Pen for tablet use, and a mouse when using for longer work periods. The Surface keyboard for the Surface series is all I need, but if you prefer you could easily use any bluetooth keyboard. I leave the power cable connected when working and the battery exceeds my needs when using as portable, I haven't timed it's drain frequency so I can't comment on the batter use under load. The only thing I would complain about it the lack of USB C, but that really isn't an issue since I don't own any USB C devices.",

First was how quickly it came! One recommendation: shop carefully. I found it significantly cheaper to purchase the keyboard separately rather than in a \"bundle.\" (The keyboard actually arrived a day before the Surface Pro.) Most of my work is done on a desktop, the Pro will be a traveling device and is an upgrade from a similar but much cheaper (smaller and slower) device. So far, I'm favorably impressed. It's fast when turned on and quite responsive. One caution is that the keyboard connection is not particularly solid--once while moving everything, the tablet actually fell off the keyboard. I won't say that I've used it enough to give a concrete review but it does seem like a good compromise between a laptop and a tablet. One pleasant surprise is that it appears possible to create a wireless connection between it and a projector/display with the purchase of the proper adaptor--I knew I'd need an adaptor but didn't realize there could be a wireless connection. Like a Barbie Doll, it's possible to spend a lot on accessories. Microsoft doesn't (or at least I couldn't find) provide a lot of helpful information for shoppers, so it can be hard to know if you're making good decisions regarding memory, etc. (The closest bricks and mortar store for me is three hours away.) I find myself wondering if a day trip would have been worth it--if only to confirm that I was making good choices. So far, so good!",

Shocked, I looked on the back on the device and found the number 1796. Wikipedia states that this corresponds to the Surface Pro 5, with only has a dual core i5. Still in disbelief at receiving an old model after paying for the latest Surface Pro 6, I checked my model number with Microsoft. Sure enough, I have a 5th generation surface pro. I double checked my box. It was factory sealed with stickers and everything. The box clearly states Microsoft Surface Pro 6.

            "review_text": "I've been looking for a way to ditch the big box PC and go mobile, and after assessing my real use ond needs I realized I didn't need a lot compared to what's available today vs. 20 years ago when my first PC had a 120 MB MFM drive the size of a small car. I usually get the biggest, fastest most feature packed, everything, that I buy. It's the Boy Scout in me I guess, always prepared for the unexpected. However, after realizing I just couldn't ditch Windows OS just yet in lieu of going all the way Andriod, I had to start looking at 2 in 1's etc. I landed on this, the Surface Pro 6. Next was trying to convince myself I needed to change my ways becasue the truth was, I didn't need an i7, 1Tb $2000+ Surface Pro. I actually heeded advice from reviews and benchmarks showing, nothing I do anymore would ever get me to performance of that machine. So next, after looking and discovering that the 2 Tb drive in my big box PC was only at about 250gb capacity with all the years of crap I had on it. Removing the things I really didn't need to have on the machine itself, like a lot of music, and a documents folder that looked like a decades old closet in a hoarders house, I accepted that I could, for the 1st time, accept the minimum spec machine. So I bought the 256gb machine instead because, well you never know,. And, prices dropped! And Black became available at the same dropped price and was in stock. So here I sit typing on the Burgundy Signature Type Cover attached to my new Surface Pro 6 in matte black, with a black Surface Pen firmly attached to the side of the Surface Pro 6 looking as cool as I've ever thought I could never actually look outside of my head! It looks that good! In just a day or so of setting up, adding my apps and programs starting to get used to being so mobile. So far, it's an easier transition that I thought, but I'll still be making a slow move before pulling the plug on the big box. Is it perfect? No, Windows isn't perfect. There's little things like the task-bar will sometimes seem to retreat and not want to come back out with your finger or pen for a short while, but ctrl-Esc pops it right up. Sometimes it seems like when going to Tablet Mode and back, some of the task-bar items don't show back up or are moved around but also easy to fix and so far nothing that's major. Surprisingly the onscreen keyboard(s) aren't as much of an issue as some report. There are options for what keyboard you want and whether you want to keep it on the task-bar etc. and you can pop it u\\open and close it for when you need or don't need it, in either PC or tablet mode. Overall, I'm really pleased with my new Surface Pro 6 in matte black, i5, 256gb variant with a Burgundy Signature Type Cover and Black Surface Pen. Going from a desk and big keyboard and a 24\" plasma TV as the screen will be a change but so far I can see it being not to bad of a move. I can't always get the Surface Dock and connect it that way if I really need a large screen fix. FYI, for battery life, changing the battery mode makes a big difference. Using max power, makes a few things run smoother and faster as you're expect., like quickly scanning through pictures and videos (like viewing a micro SD card from a game camera quickly skipping past each) but cutting it back to max battery savings also extends it a lot. Some reviews claim battery life isn't near what's advertised, but what's advertised is best scenario and can't account for everyone's usage. I've found the more conservative battery setting is more than enough for most of what I do, with only minor differences when there is a difference. It's a case of YMMV, you're in control of battery life but either way, it's really good! I can't not mention graphics. Wow!! Images are incredible, video, streaming etc. is amazing. It's hard not to want to say it's the best display I've ever experienced.",

Everything important was saved on my mounted SD card. Apparently its a big problem with that model. Anyway... I loved the versatility of the SurfacePro4 so much I immediately started saving up for the Surface Pro 6. Its not cheap. But it is beautiful, adaptable and just such a joy to use! Whens the last time using a gadget made you smile? (No, Rabbits dont count) I have the core i5, 8GB ram variant and it performs everything I throw at it with ease. I use it for photo-editing (Gimp), MS Office, website creation, web browsing, Youtube, movies, music and some light gaming (Hitman absolution). Not once has it stuttered. The pen is a must have if you're into sketching and all that. I personally use it for signatures and marking out points in emails and photos. Pros: - Very responsive screen - Speakers have excellent clarity - Great battery Life (I get over 6 hours with light-moderate use) - Lovely build quality (tho get a cover for it if you want to prevent scratches) - Great functionality in either tablet or laptop mode Cons: - From a physical perspective, its not easy to hold as tablet in one hand, unless you have a case with the strap (Check Targus and Joy) - Lack of connection ports (Only one usb 3.0 port and a mini display port), why guys, whyyy? - The kick stand is great, however its sort of sharp if you use it on your lap while wearing shorts.

I was absolutely blown away with a few aspects of this device. I was marking up a very large PDF, a layout of the entire building I was in, complete with all city water plumbing drawn. Zooming, panning, marking up, nothing ended up fazing this device performance wise. I used Drawboard PDF, which was exactly fit for my purpose. I was there surveying for 6 hours, no breaks and no charging. I ended up with 63% battery left! Amazing considering the workload(this was a LARGE PDF)! I really cannot say enough good things about this device. I ended up buying the Surface Pen and it is absolutely worth it over the Ciscle. I don't have a single complaint at the moment about this device. I highly recommend it. Original Review:--- I was debating between a new i5 Pro6 and a refurb i5 Pro 5, until I learned that the new i5 in the Pro 6 is a real 4 core 8 thread. I opted for the 6, and oh boy am I glad I did. Performance wise, it really is kind of amazing that a system this powerful can run on passive cooling. I have been mostly using the Surface to annotate PDFs of building blueprints using Drawboard. Zooming, panning, writing, all of it is as fluid as I could ask for, even on massive PDFs of entire factory buildings. Aesthetically, the Surface is a REALLY handsome device. Very pleasing to the eye, and very ergonomic as well. I love folding down into studio mode for drawing. Drawing is great. I opted for a cheap 3rd party pen(Ciscle), but I think I will probably buy a Surface Pen before too long. It is impressive how little lag there is for drawing, it really does feel very natural. I was debating long and hard with myself whether to get the Surface Pro 6, or just get a cheap windows tablet. 300% price difference, but I am absolutely, hands down glad I got the Pro. Awesome device.",

            "review_text": "To provide context, I bought the Surface Pro 6 to replace my Surface Pro 4 which I traded in at my university's tech store. Display: The display on the Surface Pro 6 is noticeably better than that on the Surface Pro 4 for one reason: contrast ratio. The blacks are blacker and everything is just more vibrant. There is also an sRGB color mode for those of you interested in editing photos or videos. In addition, backlight bleed is virtually nonexistent which was a minor issue on my SP4. The display also gets quite a bit brighter than that of the SP4 which helps significantly in outdoor use. Performance: The performance of the SP6 is noticeably faster than that of the SP4 in day to day tasks, mostly due to doubling the cores and threads (4 & 8 vs 2 & 4). Jumping through powerpoint, excel, word, multiple tabs, and even the notorious CPU hog that is Skype was much snappier. Doing a quick Geekbench, the SP6 is in the performance range of a non-overclocked desktop i5 3570k. SSD performance is also very fast, but it still trails behind what Apple is able to achieve. Battery Life: This is the main reason I wanted to upgrade, as the SP4's battery life was its Achilles heel even when it was new. With my mixed workload of web browsing, MS-office, youtube, Onenote, etc., I would get about 4.5 hours of battery life on the SP4. With the SP6, it's about 8.5 hours. Naturally, your mileage will vary depending on your unique use case, but needless to say, the battery is no longer a weak point of the Surface Pro line. Connectivity: This is honestly the flawed aspect of the SP6. The only ports are a headphone jack (thank you!), a surface connect port, a USB A 3.0 port, and a mini-display port. Not having USB C (preferably thunderbolt 3) on a new device in 2018 is going to be a dealbreaker for some. Personally, the surface acts as my mobile machine with a desktop for work at home, so I almost never need to connect it to a display/peripherals. For those looking to use their surface as a primary machine, it may be a dealbreaker; it depends on your workflow. In terms of Wifi performance, I've had no issues. Keyboard and Pen: I'm using the same keyboard and pen that I used with the SP4, because they are forward compatible. The SP6 keyboard is virtually identical to the SP4 keyboard, so my commentary should still apply. The keys have great spacing and travel, and the trackpad, while small, is smooth and accurate. I can't comment on the latest generation Surface Pen, but for those coming to the SP6 with an older pen in tow, you do still benefit from the improved latency of the SP6 compared to the SP4 and older models. It was a pleasant surprise, and writing on the SP6 feels even more natural as a result. The Little Things: Windows Hello is still awesome and faster than ever. With the instant wake of the SP6, I'm in within 2 seconds of tapping the power button. The build quality is also still exceptional. Overall, the Surface Pro 6 feels like a solid upgrade for users of the Surface Pro 4 and older with significantly better performance and battery life. Being able to use older accessories is on the SP6 is just icing on the cake.",

First of all, FU Microsoft forcing me to pay $200 extra for an awkward, uncomfortable, poor quality keyboard. The pen is great, kinda... if you use it yes. If you use it rarely, it's just a very expensive thing to rattle around in your laptop bag. Which AGAIN, you have to pay extra for. Ok so, as a tablet it is awesome... right? Yes, right... as a tablet. Not a Windows computer. In tablet mode, so many websites would not scroll for some reason. So many programs were useless because they're not designed for touch. One very notable case being Adobe. The entire Adobe suite pretty much requires a mouse and keyboard to use effectively. Yes, Adobe has touch versions of some programs, but you don't need a $1500 tablet if you're gonna use those. Yes, some Adobe programs, like Indesign have touch modes, but... who uses Indesign? Photoshop and Premier suck on touch, and they're really everything people use. So it's a good laptop! Yes, correct it is a excellent performing laptop. But is a useless laptop. You can't use it on your any better than you can eat dinner while balancing your plate on one finger. The the back stand and afore mentioned overpriced keyboard is. I'll spare you the list of ways you cannot use it and just say, on a table is the only way you will. Needless to say, I returned it and I spent 1/4 the cost on an ultra-thin convertible and SO MUCH BETTER at being a laptop and being a tablet. I will give MS credit. What they packed into that device is freaking groundbreaking. But like a massive mandangle, impressive does not automatically mean useful. The weird thing is they actually made an ultra-thin laptop version of the surface, but the neutered performance for some odd reason so it can't even compete with other u-thins in it's price range.",

The image quality is just gorgeous and top-notch. The audio output is super loud and crisp, not what I expected from a tablet. I don't even need to use a Bluetooth speaker! The build is superb and sturdy. Battery is great, lasts the entire day on Battery Saver and \"Suggested\" brightness but even with the \"Balanced\" and \"Brighter\" setting, it still lasts long. Very responsive (of course it's an 8th gen chip). Windows Hello works well even if the tablet is vertically oriented. Haven't tried games yet except for Asphalt 9 but I haven't detected any hiccups. The lack of USB-C isn't an issue to me. All in all, a great product. The seller is also very speedy in their delivery. I ordered this at the same time as the Type Cover and Pen from a different seller and it arrived earlier than those two. Update: Now that I have the new Surface Pen and Surface Type Cover, this beauty is amazing. I can't imagine reading books and annotating and highlighting without a pen now. The keyboard is very clicky and a joy to type with. The trackpad too is great.",

I was compelled to buy a Surface Pro when I needed to do tasks outside my work computer that couldn't be fulfilled by my Samsung tablet. I'm pleasantly impressed by this machine. It's the perfect hybrid -- extremely lightweight, highly portable but capable of doing all those things that lazy developers haven't brought to the tablet universe yet. I'm totally sold. I really love this design. It was a bit of an investment (~$1k with the keyboard accessory) but the sting eases as you use it. It's a powerful little travel companion, keeping me well connected on the road. I'll admit. It's not the fanciest machine or the heaviest duty processor but it's a good household machine for when you want some distance to have hobbies outside of your work life. (Admit it. You're using your work computer to read this review...) Plus these days if you really need advanced compute, you can use an AWS workspace to spin up the right machine for that specific task and spin it down. Overall, I'm converted. I can't imagine not having this machine in my arsenal. I feel like a wizard. I'm much more organized and productive having a machine that's capable of being both a tablet and a legitimate PC.

Eventually was able to figure that out by viewing the product picture.. Only other point is that I was disappointed that apparently Amazon hasn't seen fit to release a Windows 10 app for Prime Video. Did read a less-than enthusiastic review from 2016 announcing it's release but couldn't find it in the MS Store. This is not just specific to the Surface Pro but is related to the OS.

I humbly offer that the six week journey to my home provided ample time. Such is the battery life that it still booted up immediately! Fortunately for all, Microsoft apparently seals their products in such a way as to foil even the most deliberate sabotage. I have not yet tested it at the gun range, but fully expect that, if I do, the screen quality is such that it would simultaneously reflect calibers sizes up to .308 while also inexplicably improving my aim.",

It has features that I probably will not even use but it is always nice to have. I use the pen mainly for note taking which does not disappoint. The pen is responsive and there are no problems with my palm touching the screen while writing. The keyboard is nice but you have to research protective cases that accommodate it being connected and that also allow full use of the great kickstand that the Surface has. The ports are limited (no usb-c as everyone knows) but I knew this going in and it does not affect my use. BOTTOMLINE- buy what suits your personal needs. There are cheaper alternatives that may lack some of the power or display quality & size etc. but you may not need that stuff for your use and you can save some money- the Surface GO may be a good alternative.

            "review_text": "For perspective on this review, I've been a Mac user since college, which for me is half a lifetime. My motivation in getting a Surface is pretty simple: I wanted a tablet for my \"casual\" usage around the house, but I still require full \"normal PC\" functionality, including the need to put the device into \"desktop\" mode. I didn't want to have to own two separate devices, and as Apple has made very clear, they are never going to offer a convertible. Even the new iPad-specific iOS version is not going to provide a true PC-like experience, nor the capacity to attach an external display. For those reasons I decided to go ahead and make the switch. Another weird side note: professionally I am a .NET systems architect, so I use Windows at work all day every day, and live in a very Microsoft world. So I'm used to using Windows, yet have never really liked it for my personal use, at home. With all that as background, I really don't have anything but praise for the Surface Pro. I don't quite understand what all the detractors are on about, honestly. It works great -- performance is excellent, as is the design and build quality. It switches very nicely to desktop mode, and works very well as a laptop replacement. The display quality, in particular, is excellent -- better than my 2016-era MacBook Pro. There are a few frustrations, of course: it's Windows OS, so that in and of itself comes along with a list of complaints. But those are all workable, and these days the OS honestly doesn't matter all that much. Windows 10 can be configured to stay pretty-much out of your way, and for me, I never really even notice what OS I'm using, any more. The iteration I purchased is the i5/8GB RAM/256GB SDD. Even as a developer and as someone who dabbles in some higher-performance photo/graphics editing, that model delivers all the performance I need -- even while driving a quad HD external monitor. The device is totally fanless, so there is absolutely no noise at all from it, which is something I really appreciate a lot. I had previously tried to switch to one of Lenovo's convertible tablets, and the fan noise drove me half crazy -- I couldn't do it, and sold the device within a week; went back to my MacBook. This time I do believe the switch is permanent. And as to that, I have to say that I don't know what Apple could possibly be thinking by not offering a convertible tablet. They've lost a lifelong customer in their stubbornness, and I doubt I'm the only one. Microsoft really has a winner on their hands with the Surface Pro. So far I really like it. I'm giving the Surface Pro 4 instead of 5 stars because there is still a lot of room for improvement. As many other reviewers have pointed-out, it's really not acceptable in 2019 to offer a device with a single, standard USB 3.0 port, and no USB C. This doesn't impact me, personally, too much, but it's still a serious drawback, generally, and I get why people are upset by it. There are also some perplexing and truly frustrating oddities in terms of switching between tablet versus desktop mode in Windows 10. For me, I don't even really see the point of having the two modes at all. Overall, though, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Surface to just about anyone.",

I am pleased overall so far, the Surface Pen works quite well with it in using it for art.

I've run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit with no errors found. I went into the System Event logs to find a number of Event ID error codes one of the most concerning is the ID37 Kernel error which might be an issue with the processor or an unbalanced Firmware update to the software which handles how the power consumption is regulated with the processor. Regardless, I called MSFT tech support and spent an hour with the India help desk. Let's just say that it was an extremely frustrating experience. This is my first experience to the Surface and I can tell you with 3 years having worked at Microsoft and going through this type of experience this has to be one of the worst customer experiences that I've had in several years.

I eventually started leaning towards the 2-in-1 laptops as I liked the freedom it provides. I was concerned however that it would not have the power to do what I needed it to. I am a budding graphic designer and web designer and I needed to run some programs on it that meant I needed more power than the average person who is just surfing the internet. I eventually took the leap and purchased this laptop and I have had no regrets. I bought the pen and keyboard that match it and then I bought a INFILAND cover to go with it. They all work wonderfully together and I can easily use this laptop while sitting at an office desk or as a tablet while lounging on the couch. I have not had any struggles running the programs I need on it. I will acknowledge that I don't have a ton of stuff downloaded on it, I keep my files on an external hard drive and in the cloud and I dont have a bunch of games on it or anything, only the programs I need for my work. The laptop seems to be well worth the price to me and I like how easy it is to move around with it. It is so light and compact. My last laptop was a 15 inch screen HP Pavilion and it is so bulky compared to this. I have already used this laptop more on a daily basis than I ever did my previous laptops as it is easier to sign in(i even have facial recognition set up onthe laptop so the moment it sees me sitting in front of it it automatically signs in), and i find it so convenient to be able to easily carry it wherever I go.",

Microsoft with the Windows monopoly has rarely put out a competitive device in the last decades. The Surface series is the exception, it combines the familiar most commonly used Windows and Apple's ingenious user friendly tablet interface. Complete my work on Word, Excel, Photoshop, detach the keyboard, sit back relax and be entertained on the couch, play games, watch video with a touch of a gesture. It is by no means seamless but close to perfection with each new release. It isn't a dedicated machine to do one job better but many regular jobs we enjoy. Each innovation is getting a step ahead of Apple, my ipad now sits in the closet. We will start with the keyboard, it is magnetically linked, no battery to charge and has a tactile feedback of a full size keyboard. The back stand easily adjust to many angles, making watching movie, typing documents, browsing the net on bed, on the floor, on the couch, on my desk, even sitting on the toilet bowl as comfortable as it can get. No it does not have a USB-C port nor a Firewire port for heavy gamer but there are a ton of accessories you can buy to meet the mass users. Microsoft does not gouge you for money like Apple and the extra microSD port they provided is proof. I added 400Gb of storage with a $78 purchase https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074RNRM2B/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I interfaced it with my TV with a $7 HDMI adapter https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GYMM3L5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It is by far the lightest laptop I have ever had for traveling, watched 3 movies downloaded from Netflix before the trip before it ever needs a charge. The screen is super bright, easy to see for my old eyes and the speakers are louder than my 15\" gaming laptop. Simply amazing, my impress of Microsoft has changed since.",

The Surface Pro line has always had great inking capabilities and this version 6 is no different (they prefer drawing onscreen vs. a dedicated WACOM pad from last Christmas, heh). That was also the best deal price wise for an i5 8GB/128GB keyboard + pen device around on this generation so far. Opted for these over the Surface Go which was an option because of the increased power of the processor (finally 8th gen i5 but not Whiskey Lake), the full keyboard size (Surface Go difficult to touch type on with cramped keyboard), and the screen size for drawing on, and the bundle worked out to only $100 more for the i5. Upon opening it up on Christmas and setting it up, the screen is really gorgeous in its vivid nicely saturated colors, and the CPU is nice and quick. I threw a couple of Samsung 128GB micro SD cards in for their local OneDrive mirrored storage for good measure. They're drawing up a storm and loving it.

Nothing that needs a Geforce Card or anything, but plenty of great modern games run just fine on this beast. I got it on sale for black Friday, bundled with the keyboard case and I can honestly say, it\u2019s been the best money I\u2019ve spent on a device in a long time.

            "review_text": "(not verified because I bought it directly from microsoft with the student discount) The surface pro is excellent in most regards design, screen quality, speed, battery, etc... but it sucks as a tablet. It's probably one of if not the best tablet on the market when it comes to being able to replace your laptop. I purchased the base i5 + 8gb specs (with the upgraded 256gb ssd), and it runs everyday stuff quite well. Absolutely no qualms with the performance. Maybe it's because I came from a 3+ year old laptop, but the screen was absolutely mind blowing when I first started using it. It's obviously a pretty high-res device, but the color is also super on point. I literally admire the screen just browsing normal websites with boring UIs lol. The battery was a bit disappoint at first, but after playing with the brightness/performance mode I was able to get a ton out of it. The 13.5 hour battery claim is probably a pretty significant exaggeration, but it's quite solid with the right settings. Everything about the pro 6 is high performance. The design is super freakin sleek, the black model looks awesome. It really hits the laptop side of the 2in1 concept. However... Windows 10 tablet mode is just so buggy that it really kills tablet use for me. I've owned my surface for 3 days, and tablet mode has already made me want to stop using it as a tablet altogether. More often than not, when I click on a text field (like google search) in chrome, the on-screen keyboard won't pop up, and I'll have to manually click the tiny keyboard button on the taskbar. Having to do this literally hundreds of times through an internet session is much more obnoxious than it sounds. Other tablet-mode bugs: -When trying to use windows 10 search at one point, the onscreen keyboard would only show up as invisible (basically just the border of the keyboard). -Every link I would click would open in a new tab. Took a bit of troubleshooting to realize that microsoft thought the control key was being held down (I definitely hadn't clicked it, and the keyboard was closed, anyway). I had to open up the onscreen keyboard, turn control on, then turn it off to fix it. -When opening up a second window in chrome, windows will randomly spaz out and switch between the two windows rapidly for a good 5-10 seconds. Bizarre. These are the bugs I encountered in just the first 3 days. I can't stress enough how annoying it is for the keyboard to not consistently popup when I click on a textfield in tablet mode. None of these bugs make the device unusable as a tablet, but they make the tablet experience frustrating. Considering the price tag of the pro 6 (plus the type cover, plus the pen), a product the costly shouldn't have such deficiencies. Unless you're really determined to have a 2-in-1, I'd grab some kind of touch screen laptop with similar specs and save a few hundred bucks. edit: took off a star cuz the battery is garbage, barely working after ~2 weeks",

Instead the technician was eager to sell me a refurbished replacement for $450. LOL. Yes $1100 only gave me 17 months of use. The cheapest Dell or HP can last more than 17 months.

I found that Asus and Lenovo had some decent offerings, but I wasn\u2019t truly impressed until I got to the Surface Pro 6. The first thing I noticed was the display. Gorgeous. I knew I had to have it as soon as I held it in portrait mode. I was absolutely sold. After a couple weeks, I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019ve made the right purchase. I love the versatility and overall functionality of this thing. I can use it as a tablet on my lap, set up the kickstand and watch a movie (on a beautiful 1824p display), or snap on the keyboard and get some work done. The keyboard has a nice clicky feel to it, way better than your average laptop keyboard. The pen is a MUST BUY in my opinion, even if you don\u2019t do much drawing. It\u2019s just part of the Surface experience. Touch screen is super responsive with very little latency and palm rejection works fairly well. I\u2019m really impressed with the performance on my i5 model. I wouldn\u2019t say this thing is a powerhouse by any means (I ran the benchmarks... they were disappointing compared to my desktop build) but the 8th gen quad core i5 is a wonderful thing, and so far I haven\u2019t had any issues with lag or slow performance. Everything has been ultra snappy. In fact, I\u2019m impressed with how much is delivered in such a thin form factor (and fan-less design). I wouldn\u2019t try to do any modern gaming or heavy video editing, but I have tested a series of multimedia production apps (Adobe CC, Davinci Resolve, Ableton Live) and found that they all worked wonderfully. I haven\u2019t been able to test the battery much, but it definitely holds a decent charge. I went out and did some studying the other day, and was still at a 70% after about three hours of continuous use. Definitely one of the best features of the SP6. Overall, the Surface Pro 6 is an absolute treat. I\u2019ve built numerous PCs over the years with much better hardware, but I can\u2019t deny the versatility and stunning build quality of the Surface Pro. To me it is probably the best PC I\u2019ve ever used. The only device that can rival the Surface Pro 6\u2019s aesthetic and functionality is Lenovo\u2019s X1 tablet (which is another solid choice, slightly more expensive).

The surface is worth every penny and doesn't seem to get hot at all Processor is quick enough to run multiple programs quickly and not slow down much Memory is sufficient Graphics card is good enough for hidden object games and games on low settings Wifi speed supports newest standards and data transfer is quick Boot time is quick about 7 seconds Battery life lasts about 6-7 hours at 50% brightness Screen is very bright and clear Speakers and loud full and clean sounding Purchased the keyboard case with fingerprint sensor and it works perfectly as well seems almost like a full laptop. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a full os on a tablet.",

I used the Surface Pro 6 for graphic design, and it is basically unusable for what I do. The problem, I found out, is the ambient cooling method instead of using fans. I do use some power hungry art software, but I didn't think it would have this much trouble. After about 30-40 minuets it would do a blue screen reboot to protect the hardware every time I used an art program. It never had any issue if I wasn't using those programs, and I could use it as long as I wanted. It is unfortunate because it has such an amazing pen and a great screen. I just love using it for the time it allowed me. Come to find out, you have to upgrade to the i7 in order to get the fans included in the system, and I would still be cautious of overheating after my experience. I hope that the next release have less of an issue with this, because I am still interested in being a Surface Pro owner.",

            "review_text": "I have a Microsoft Surface pro 6 with i7 processor, 16gb ram, 256gb hard drive. I bought this computer hoping to draw, with the newest stylist, and do general writing on Word. I also use it for photo editing using Affinity culling through over 3,000 photos. Overall, I have found the machine difficult to use with the programs I like. (Affinity, Art Rage, Adobe sketchbook, and Word mostly. I also use the photo program that comes with the machine). For drawing I find the Apple Pro outperforms this machine. The combination of the Apple Pro and it's Apple pencil work better, is more accurate, and gives the user a more artistic feel. For working in Affinity Photo, Krita Art or other large art programs, the icons on the programs are so small that I can't see them. Literally, there are so many commands shown on the screen that the print is micro-sized. As I write this review, the print is micro-sized as well. I have not had super small print problems on other laptops. The one game I've tried to play on this machine, is The Operational Art of War 4 from Matrix games. This is a fairly intensive game that uses a lot of computer power, but the makers have figured out how to run it on normal computers with 4 gigs or less RAM and far less speed than my Surface pro 6 has; nonetheless, the game would not play on the Surface Pro. I downloaded it on an older computer with much less RAM and a lesser chip and the game ran fine. I tried loading the game onto the Surface several times, and completely erasing the game each time before the download, but it still fails to run the war game. The keyboard is very good. The pressure on the keys is almost perfect and I have not had the trampoline problems others have reported. The keyboard is thin but works well. One major complaint is the pad in the center of the palm rest. I don't know how it works but it doesn't work anything like the pad on a previous Apple laptop. A very, very light tap seems to trigger the command, and a strong push that causes the pad to click doesn't do anything. Tough for me to figure out. I have attached a normal cheap mouse and that works fine. Using the Surface pen (stylist) doesn't make things any better except when freehand drawing. It does work like your finger on the screen when scrolling, but trying to hit a small command box is harder than using the mouse. In drawing, I feel the stylist is nowhere near as good as the Apple pencil. Overall, the Surface is a disappointment. I bought the fastest, strongest machine I could so runing the photo programs and the art programs would be easy.. However, the programs do not run well on the Surface pro 6, the pen is hard to use for drawing, and the drawing programs have problems the pen does not overcome. Even the Word program is glitchy, in that, I have lost portions of my documents instantly... and without explanation. Out of nowhere I lost two thirds of a long review while I was right in the middle of typing a sentence. No explanationl from Microsoft, and others have complained. This might not be a problem restricted to the Surface, but I've never experienced this difficultly before I started with the Surface and I have not had the problem with any other machine. AD2",

Been a month no issues even updating to 1809 tho took some hours due to slower wifi connection. Added the Microsoft Dock picked up for $126 to drive external monitors. Use to have the iPad Pro 10.5\" and was the perfect size for holding and writing and drawing. And still gives the closest inking and writing to actual writing. But Microsoft has made some great strides in getting real close to matching the iPad experience. And does a real good job in matching drawing and writing experience. Got the Black version so concerned with some complaints about easily scratched or chipping on edges. So far being careful always laying down on keyboard cover side. Don't notice any chipping or scratches yet. Finally did a all out battery test yesterday to see if it lived up to it's 8hrs - 9hrs battery claims by others. SP 6 i5/8gb/256gb Pencil Arc Mouse. Mini-Display Cable driving 23\" Display. Yep on battery power no A.C. to the SP. On 1809 update got a week ago. Battery set on \"Better Performance\" one notch down from \"Best Performance\" Not even trying the lower battery savings settings. Screen at 50% set screen and shutdown to \"Never\" as wanted system always on for drain down test. So had Firefox open always 2-8 tabs open loading pages. During the test two different times during the day a 1hr. Youtube and 2hr. Youtube video played thru in Firefox. File Explorer,Task Manager open. Also OneNote drawing and writing on and off over the day. Wordpad was typing up documents. Autodesk Sketchbook working on sketch. Doing all driving 23\" Display also. Taking breaks away from time to time. After 7.5hrs was at 10% battery from starting at 100%. Highly recommend the Microsoft Complete for $149 as will give an additional year and two incidents of accidental breakage. Which takes a load of worries on my mind. Have up to 45days after device purchase to acquire it. Next month or so plan to complete replace my 2010 Win7 Amd dual-core aging desktop. Will acquire a 32\" 4k display to go along with my 23\" older monitor for dual display setup. Add a external keyboard,mouse,speakers for a complete desktop replacement. That I can grab the surface throw in my camera bag and use out on a shoot. So far zero issues. No light bleed I can see might be a tiny bit? No windows updates going bonkers. Sleeps and wakes up just fine. No parallax error or lagging except on using large custom brushes. Exceptionally Happy overall. Kind of dismayed of the price but sale price made it for me. Also finding the heavier and bulkier 12.3\" screen more cumbersome hand holding. Have to look into maybe a hand strap to help that. Otherwise plan to be my desktop replacement and tablet/laptop on the go.",

Why The Surface Worked for Me: My version of the Surface is the i5 processor with 8 GB of Ram and 256 GB of storage. To tech enthusiasts, this would come across as a very low-performance laptop, but in reality, when you\u2019re on the go, this is still excellent performance to portability. For example, after pulling my Surface out from my backpack, it is always ready to work as it boots on in a second. From there, I double click my Surface Pen and my notes are right in front of me. The touchscreen and pen combo then allows me to write my notes as if I\u2019m writing on a piece of paper. Meanwhile, everyone else is still waiting for their bulky laptops to turn on, and I\u2019m ready to face the day. Also, as a Computer Science major, I was surprised at how well the Surface handled big applications in terms of battery life. I usually have several large applications open for entire days ranging from word to excel to even running a server in the background. Despite all the apps running in the background, I am still going through my classes without any hiccups. Even after an overnight stay in the library without a charger, the laptop still has enough power to last me another day. Why it Would Work for You: -You would like a 2-in-1 tablet and laptop combo. -You are always on the go and need to be lightweight. -You want something that is both powerful and can go anywhere with you. -You are often away from an outlet or charger. -You want an intuitive laptop that makes your day easier. -You are a student or often travel. Why it Would Not Work for You: -You rarely see a need for a touch screen. -You have no reason to have a small laptop. -You agree that the price to specs is on the high side, especially for the better models. Final Thoughts: As a student, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 6 met all of my needs. However, the price may be too high and it may not fit all your needs. So, if you feel like you\u2019ve wanted a 2-in-1 laptop that is sleek, powerful, and convenient, then I recommend giving the Surface Pro a shot.",

I liked the fact that it ran Windows 10 and could also function as a laptop and \"portable desktop\" if needed. As a tablet, I found it glitchy and ill-conceived. The on-screen keyboard functioned inconsistently, and the taskbar was intermittently unresponsive which made it almost impossible to use. I spent hours with Microsoft support trying to get it to work properly, but nothing they did made any difference so I returned it after a week. When reading pdfs, I also found the image quality to be inferior to my desktop and other devices I own; letters were not smooth and had a block-like appearance when zoomed-in. After reading some reviews online, I suspect there may have been nothing wrong with my Surface Pro 6, and the problems I experienced were likely secondary to Windows 10 being a poor tablet OS.
